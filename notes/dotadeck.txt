The DotaDeck route currently implements a card-based game where users can purchase and manage hero cards. The interface features a top navigation with score/gold display and action buttons, a main game area showing the current hand of cards, and a shop modal for purchasing new cards. Users can select and delete cards from their hand, purchase new cards from the shop (with visual and audio feedback), and manage their collection. The UI has been styled with a dark theme featuring gradients, glows, and smooth transitions. Each card displays its cost, type, and stats with a procedurally generated background pattern.

Next Steps:
The code needs significant refactoring to properly implement the round system. Currently, UserCards are used directly, but we need to transition to using RoundUserCards for active games. When a round starts, we should create RoundUserCard entries for each card in the player's hand, linking them to the new Round. As matches are played, we'll need to calculate scores based on each card's effect type and stat type - for example, a STAT_MULTIPLIER card for KILLS would multiply the player's kills by some factor, while a SCORE_MULTIPLIER would affect the final round score. The RoundUserCard schema currently tracks multiplierAchieved and scoreContribution, which will be crucial for this - multiplierAchieved should store the actual multiplier achieved during the round (e.g., 2.5x for kills), while scoreContribution should store how many points this card added to the final score. This will allow us to show detailed breakdowns of how each card performed in a round and track card performance over time.
