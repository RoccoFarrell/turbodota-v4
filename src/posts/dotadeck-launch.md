Greetings Turbodota challengers! üî•

### DotaDeck has arrived - and it's about to heat up the competition!

We're thrilled to announce the launch of DotaDeck, where players compete over a shared deck of Hero Cards! In this exciting new game mode, you'll:

- Draw Hero Cards into your hand
- Level them up through victories
- Earn gold and XP for each match win
- Hunt for the highest-value Hero Cards

### How It Works

All players share the same deck of Hero Cards, with each card's value growing over time. Draw up to three cards and compete to win matches with the most valuable heroes:

- **Win a match**: Claim the bounty of gold and XP! The Hero Card returns to base stats and goes back into the shared pool
- **Lose a match**: The Hero Card gains gold and XP, making it an even bigger prize for the next player
- **Discard a hero**: Boost the Hero Card's stats before returning it to the pool (limited to 5 discards)

### Managing Your Discards

Each player starts with 5 discard tokens. Use them wisely:
- Spend a token to discard a Hero Card you don't want to play
- Your tokens refresh after completing a match (win or loss)
- Once you're out of tokens, you must play a match to continue discarding

The strategy lies in hunting for those high-value Hero Cards that other players have powered up through losses and discards. Will you play it safe with fresh cards, or risk it all trying to win with that juicy bounty everyone's been eyeing?

### Season 1 Begins Now

The inaugural season of DotaDeck is officially underway. The shared deck awaits, the bounties are growing, and the leaderboard is wide open. Who will emerge as the first DotaDeck master?

May fortune favor the bold, and may the best Hero win! üèÜ

Thanks,
