Greetings Turbodota challengers!

### The Dark Rift has opened — and only the strongest will survive.

We're thrilled to announce the launch of **The Dark Rift**, a brand new gauntlet mode for the incremental game! Assemble your most powerful lineup of trained heroes and lead them through an ever-deepening rift filled with dangerous enemies. Each level ramps up the difficulty — how deep can you go?

### How It Works

The Dark Rift is a roguelike-style gauntlet that puts your heroes to the ultimate test:

- **Build Your Lineup**: Select your strongest trained heroes from your roster
- **Enter the Rift**: Navigate through a path of combat encounters, elite fights, and boss battles
- **Survive the Gauntlet**: Your heroes' HP carries over between fights — manage your resources wisely
- **Find Sanctuary**: Heal your party at sanctuary nodes scattered throughout the rift
- **Clear Levels**: Beat the boss to clear a level and unlock the next, where enemies are even tougher

### The Challenge Scales

Every level in the Dark Rift multiplies enemy stats. Level 1 is just the beginning — by level 5, enemies hit harder, tank more damage, and punish sloppy lineups. The key to going deeper? Training your heroes at the barracks, optimizing your lineup composition, and knowing when to push forward and when to heal.

### Compete With Friends

Dark Rift Leagues let you and your friends compete to see who can clear the deepest level. The leaderboard tracks your deepest cleared level and best lineup DPS, so every training session and every upgrade matters in the race to the bottom of the rift.

| Stat | What It Tracks |
| -------- | ------ |
| Deepest Level | Highest rift level you've cleared |
| Best Lineup DPS | Total DPS from your best run's lineup |
| Runs Completed | Total successful clears in the season |

### Ready to Descend?

The void is waiting. Train your heroes, build your lineup, and enter The Dark Rift. Just remember — the deeper you go, the harder it gets. And down there in the dark, there's no guarantee you're coming back.

Good luck, challengers.

Thanks,
No Salt Studios
