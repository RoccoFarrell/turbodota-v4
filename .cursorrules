# Cursor Rules for TurboDota v4

## Documentation Organization

If you create any markdown files for planning or tracking, place them in the `docs` folder, and under a subfolder related to which part of the codebase it's related to.

Example structure:
- `docs/upgrades/` - for upgrade and migration plans
- `docs/api/` - for API documentation
- `docs/architecture/` - for architecture documentation
- etc.
