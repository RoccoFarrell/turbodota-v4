# Cursor Rules for TurboDota v4

## Documentation Organization

If you create any markdown files for planning or tracking, place them in the `docs` folder, and under a subfolder related to which part of the codebase it's related to.

Example structure:
- `docs/upgrades/` - for upgrade and migration plans
- `docs/api/` - for API documentation
- `docs/architecture/` - for architecture documentation
- etc.

## Migration Tools Directive

**CRITICAL**: If a migration tool needs to be run and fails (e.g., requires interactive terminal, TTY errors, etc.), DO NOT attempt to apply changes manually. Instead, stop and prompt the user to run the migration tool manually. This directive applies to all migration tools including but not limited to:
- `npx sv migrate` (Svelte migration)
- `npx svelte-migrate` (SvelteKit migration)
- `npx skeleton migrate` (Skeleton migration)
- Tailwind CSS migration tools
- Any other automated migration scripts

## Card Battler Development Rules

When working on the card battler feature (following `docs/card-battler/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`):

### Library Usage
- **ALWAYS** prefer existing libraries in `package.json` over installing new ones
- Check available libraries before adding dependencies:
  - SvelteKit features for backend (`@sveltejs/kit`)
  - Skeleton UI components (`@skeletonlabs/skeleton`, `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte`)
  - Tailwind CSS utilities (`tailwindcss`, `tailwind-merge`, `tailwind-variants`)
  - Prisma for database (`@prisma/client`, `prisma`)
  - Vitest for testing (`vitest`, `@vitest/ui`)
  - Bits UI components (`bits-ui`)
  - Other existing dependencies as appropriate

### Progress Tracking
- **MUST** maintain `docs/card-battler/PROGRESS.md` documenting:
  - Completed milestones with checkboxes
  - Test results for each milestone
  - Any blockers or issues encountered
  - Date completed and verification status
- Update progress immediately after completing and testing each milestone

### Documentation Updates
- **ALWAYS** update relevant markdown docs in `docs/card-battler/` after code changes:
  - `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` - Mark completed milestones
  - `PROGRESS.md` - Document completion status
  - `README.md` - Update if architecture changes
  - `BATTLE_MECHANICS.md` - Update if mechanics change
  - `HERO_SPECIFICS.md` - Update if hero data changes
  - Other relevant docs as needed

### Backend Development
- Use **SvelteKit** for all backend functionality:
  - API routes: `src/routes/api/battler/**/+server.ts`
  - Server load functions: `+page.server.ts` or `+layout.server.ts`
  - Server hooks: `src/hooks.server.ts`
  - Form actions: Use SvelteKit form actions
  - Database access: Use Prisma client in server-side code only
  - Reference: https://kit.svelte.dev/docs

### Frontend Development
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling:
  - Utility-first approach
  - Use existing Tailwind config and variants
  - Leverage `tailwind-merge` for conditional classes
- Use **Skeleton UI** components and features:
  - Prefer Skeleton components over custom implementations
  - Use Skeleton theme system for colors and styling
  - Reference: https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/svelte/get-started/introduction
  - Available components: Buttons, Cards, Forms, Dialogs, Menus, etc.

### Development Workflow
1. Review milestone dependencies in `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`
2. Implement milestone following the roadmap structure
3. Write tests as specified in the milestone
4. Run tests and verify functionality
5. Update `PROGRESS.md` with completion status
6. Update relevant documentation files
7. Mark milestone as complete in `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`
